### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for coming to my GitHub profile. I am currently working on conducting data analysis on:

- The correlation between the business success of a restaurant and its geographic location
- Conduct computer vision on brain tumor classification with Mask-R CNN Model

# For fun, I have also created a mini mine-sweeper program which can:

- Calculate the probability of mines via the Problem-Constraint Python module and pre-defined algorisms which can separate tiles with independent probability

# I would like to conduct another project for my self-fulfillment after completing the above projects and uploading it in my personal websites, especially: 

- A self-made generative AI which can detect my draft picture, automatically colored and add features in it, to make a comic with stabilised art style
- A language practicing web app that helps me to record my grammar errors, as I am learning french and the grammar rules are quite complicated.

# Stay tuned, my website will be launched in Jan 2025!
